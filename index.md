title: Hello World!

My name is Szymon "KatJon" Wróbel, I am student of Computer Science on University of Science and Technology in Wrocław. On this blog I will focus mostly on functional and logic programming but maybe also some low level aspects. 

Main topics
---
* Functional programming
    + [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org)
    + Functional aspects of JavaScript
* Formally verified software and theorem proving in [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr)
* Category Theory
* Logic programming: [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org), [Curry](http://www-ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/currywiki/)

Layout and engine
---
I'm using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) for managing blog. I'm still working on the layout, but my main goal (probably a bit weird) was to make my page useful in `lynx`, therefore strong `no-js` policy (maybe the only use-case that I would permit would be for MathJax, but as of now, I don't really need it).

Apart from that I try to make the site look simple, yet robust and useful.
